			<p>This ebook was privately produced using the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/tools">Standard Ebooks Toolset</a> and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/manual">manual of style</a>, and builds on the hard work of <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Roman <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Kocourek</b> and <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Fr.</abbr> Joseph Kenny, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">O.P.</abbr></b>.</p>
			<p>This particular ebook is based on an HTML edition from <a href="https://dhspriory.org/">The Dominican House of Studies in Washington, D.C.</a>, available free of charge online.</p>
			<p>It was produced to address the lack of freely available, high-quality, readable English ePUBs for St. Thomas Aquinas's works, as existing PDFs were often low-quality scans, amateur documents, or embedded in large collections. It should enable convenient reading on e-readers, as part of personal study and should serve as the first step into a long-term journey into Thomistic philosophy.</p>
